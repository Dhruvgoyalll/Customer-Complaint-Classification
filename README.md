# Customer-Complaint-Classification

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to automatically classify customer complaints into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It simulates an intelligent triaging system for handling product-related complaints in highly regulated industries such as healthcare.

## üìå Features

- Preprocesses raw text using standard NLP techniques
- Implements multiple classification models (SVM, LSTM)
- Classifies complaints into categories such as:
  - Product Issue
  - Billing Problem
  - Service Quality
  - Others
- Evaluates model performance using cross-validation
- (Optional) Interactive web interface using Streamlit
